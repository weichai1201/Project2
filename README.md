## 11056 Project 2 Reflection

There's a picture that shows my process, downloading Eleventy and Running the Browser. ï¼ˆassets/images/run the browser and install eleventy.png)

A web page is a picture seen in a browser, also known as a Web page, in fact, it is a file, stored in a server connected with the Internet. The static Web page refers to the fixed content of the Web page. When the viewer requests the Web server to replace the Web content through the HTTP protocol of the Internet, the server only transmits the original static HTML document to the user, and the content of the page is only the standard HTML code. Static web files usually have suffix names such as HTM and HTML. Many enterprise web pages at all levels are presented as static web pages.

In Project2, we learned how to use Static Site Generator to draw web pages. First, I learned how to install Eleventy and how to install Node.js, as well as Ben's Eleventy Starter Project, how to start the server with cmd Prompt, Copy the local URL to test the site. How to use code snippets on.eleventy. js file, display images in css and .md file and HTML template. I encountered many difficulties in the folder structure, such as the folder of final-website that cannot be modified, how to get the best output through index.md, and how to make multiple pages with static site generator.
