## 11056 Project 2 Reflection

A web page is a picture seen in a browser, also known as a Web page, in fact, it is a file, stored in a server connected with the Internet. The static Web page refers to the fixed content of the Web page. When the viewer requests the Web server to replace the Web content through the HTTP protocol of the Internet, the server only transmits the original static HTML document to the user, and the content of the page is only the standard HTML code. Static web files usually have suffix names such as HTM and HTML. Many enterprise web pages at all levels are presented as static web pages.

In Project2, we learned how to use Static Site Generator to draw web pages.
